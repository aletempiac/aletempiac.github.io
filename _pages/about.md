I am a Doctoral Candidate in the department of Computer and Communication Sciences at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology of Lausanne (EPFL). My research interests include design automation, logic synthesis, and emerging technologies.

In my research, I focus on developing innovative algorithms and data structures that enhance the power, performance, and area (PPA) metric of digital circuits. My primary areas of investigation revolve around logic synthesis and technology mapping for ASICs and FPGAs. Additionally, I explore synthesis methods for new emerging technologies with unique constraints, distinct from CMOS. As a promising class of beyond-CMOS technologies, I concentrate on two families of superconducting electronics: Rapid Single-Flux Quantum (RSFQ) and the Adiabatic Quantum-Flux Parametron (AQFP).

Most of my work has been open-sourced and is available in the logic synthesis library [Mockturtle](https://github.com/lsils/mockturtle).

I am a maintainer of the [EPFL Combinational Benchmark Suite](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lsi/page-102566-en-html/benchmarks/) and its associated contest. The best results from the contest are presented annually at the [International Workshop on Logic & Synthesis](https://www.iwls.org/).
