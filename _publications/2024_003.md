Superconducting electronics provide us with cryogenic digital circuits that can rival established technologies in performance and energy consumption. This review focuses on methods, algorithms, and open-source design tools for logic synthesis of superconducting circuits in two major families: single-flux quantum (SFQ) circuits and adiabatic quantum flux parametron (AQFP).
