Individual transistors based on emerging reconfigurable nanotechnologies exhibit electrical conduction for both types of charge carriers. These transistors, referred to as reconfigurable field-effect transistors (RFETs), enable dynamic reconfiguration to demonstrate either a p- or an n-type functionality. This duality of functionality at the transistor level is efficiently abstracted as a self-dual Boolean logic. In this article, we specifically aim to preserve self-duality by using Xor-majority graphs (XMGs) as the logic representation during logic synthesis and technology mapping.
