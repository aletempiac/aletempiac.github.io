This paper proposes a versatile mapping approach that has three objectives: it can map from one technology-independent graph representation to another; it can map to a cell library; it supports logic rewriting. The mapper is the first one of its kind to support remapping among various graph representations, thus enabling specialized mapping to emerging technologies and for security applications.
