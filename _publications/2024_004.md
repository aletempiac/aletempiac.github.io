Logic rewriting is a powerful optimization technique that replaces small sections of a Boolean network with better implementations. In this paper, we propose a technique to enable the usage of don't cares in logic rewriting based on pre-computed databases. We show how to process the database and perform Boolean matching with Boolean don't cares, with negligible run time overhead.
