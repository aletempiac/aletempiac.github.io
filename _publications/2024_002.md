Technology mapping transforms a technology-independent representation into a technology-dependent one given a library of cells. This process is performed by means of local replacements that are extracted by matching sections of the subject graph to library cells. Matching techniques are classified mainly into pattern and Boolean. These two techniques differ in quality and number of generated matches, scalability, and run time. This paper proposes hybrid matching, a new methodology that integrates both techniques in a technology mapping algorithm.
