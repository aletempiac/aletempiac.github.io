Ashenhurst-Curtis decomposition (ACD) is a decomposition technique used, in particular, to map combinational logic into lookup tables (LUTs) structures when synthesizing hardware designs. This paper presents a novel fast and versatile technique of ACD suitable for delay optimization. We use this new formulation to compute two-level decompositions into a variable number of LUTs and enhance delay-driven LUT mapping by performing ACD on the fly.
