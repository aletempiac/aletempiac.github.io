Adiabatic superconducting devices are promising candidates to develop high-speed/low-power electronics. Being the technology fundamentally different from CMOS, new challenges are posed to design automation tools: library cells are controlled by multi-phase clocks, they implement the majority logic function, and they have limited fanout. We present a product-level RTL-to-GDSII flow for the design of Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametron (AQFP) electronic circuits, with a focus on the special techniques used to comply with these challenges.
