This paper presents a scalable method to increase the support of multi-output library cells in technology mapping. Our contributions include 1) an approach to detect multi-output cells, 2) a fast Boolean matching methodology, and 3) a technology mapping algorithm that supports multi-output cells. Unlike previous work, we address the mapping problem over the whole network. This has the advantage of optimizing area and delay without requiring many incremental steps.
