The majority-inverter graph (MIG) is a homogeneous logic network widely used in logic synthesis for majority-based emerging technologies. In this paper, we explore combinations of well-developed MIG optimization algorithms using an on-the-fly design space exploration strategy and present the latest best results on MIG size minimization of EPFL benchmarks.
