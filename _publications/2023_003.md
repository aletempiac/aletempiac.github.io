Ashenhurst-Curtis decomposition (ACD) is well-known and widely used in logic synthesis for logic restructuring to save area and reduce delay, and in technology dependent optimization to overcome structural bias when mapping into LUTs and LUT structures. However, available implementations of ACD suffer from excessive complexity and slow runtime. The paper offers several simplifications that allow for a fast and flexible implementation of ACD using truth tables for functions up to 16 inputs. A practical extension allows for an efficient use of ACD in delay-driven mapping, which can enhance state-of-the-art LUT mappers.
