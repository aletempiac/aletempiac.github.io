Content
=======
The course will present the most outstanding features of hardware compilation, as well as the techniques for optimizing logic representations and networks. The course gives a novel, uptodate view of digital circuit design. Practical sessions will teach students the use of current design tools.

Syllabus: 1) Modeling languages and specification formalisms; 2) High-level synthesis and optimization methods (scheduling, binding, data-path and control synthesis); 3) Representation and optimization of combinational logic functions (encoding problems, binary decision diagrams); 4) Representation and optimization of multiple-level networks (algebraic and Boolean methods, "don't care" set computation, timing verification and optimization); 5) Modeling and optimization of sequential functions and networks (retiming); 6) Semicustom libraries and library binding.
